Info: DDR4_EMIF.emif_fm_0: When ECC is enabled, a partial write using the DM pins triggers a read-modify-write operation.  Frequent partial writes can lead to poor efficiency.
Info: DDR4_EMIF.emif_fm_0.arch: Agilex EMIF IP requires EMIF Calibration IP to source its calbus clock and calbus conduit.
Info: DDR4_EMIF.emif_fm_0.arch: PHY and controller running at 2x the frequency of user logic for improved efficiency.
Info: DDR4_EMIF.emif_fm_0.arch: Placement of address/command pins must follow "DDR4 Scheme 2: Component and DIMM".
Info: DDR4_EMIF.emif_fm_0.arch: Interface estimated to require 2 I/O Bank(s) and 3 I/O PLL(s). This is only an estimation. Final usage depends on user pin location assignments and/or fitter behavior.
Info: DDR4_EMIF.emif_fm_0.arch: Valid memory frequencies for the current PLL reference clock of 33.333 MHz and user clock rate, in MHz: 1599.98, 1466.65, 1333.32, 1199.99, 1066.66, 933.32, 799.99, 666.66
